<img src="vinz.jpg" alt="Blabla" width="400" height="500">
	<p>	I live in a small town called carigara and ive been studying Computer for three years in Holy Cross College of Carigara. I love exploring technologies,and my skill is I know how all the technologies works without any teaching. My life is full of changes in grade 11 i experienced being a Bad student I always skip classes, But grade 12 I realized that my life is meaning less if I continue those foolishness works I tried to change my life and it was succesful. Thankfully I have classmates that helped me to chaged my life and I realize that I there are people around me that wanted to be my friend.</p>
